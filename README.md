# Insurance-Pricing-Analysis

The dataset comes from AIcrowd and is provided by a large auto insurance provider in a European country and contains real historical auto insurance policies in the past four years. It consists of 26 columns and around 228k rows. 
In the final project, we would like to analyze this dataset to identify the following questions: How to make the insurance company obtain the highest profit by establishing the pricing model? 
We will use Python to do our following analysis and hope to answer the questions we address above. We will implement our final project from the following five aspects: EDA, methodology, data preparation and processing, model construction and conclusion.
